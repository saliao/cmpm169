			<h1>Experiment 6 - Grammars & Text Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I wanted to make an insult generator because I remember looking at one called "Shakespeare Insult Generator."</p>
				<p>link:https://codepo8.github.io/shakespeare-insult-generator/</p>
				<p>I wanted to make mine seem more animated and instead of Shakspeare I mostly asked chatGPT fpr a word bank of insulting nouns, verbs and adjectives."</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning about the basics of the Tracery library from class and also the official github page, it was very easy for me to definte the rules and grammar.</p>
				<p>I could generate random insults now in the form of "You are one #adjective# #noun# that likes to #verb#".</p>
				<p>I also needed to animate the insult words moving down like casino slots too and I borrowed most of my code from here:https://editor.p5js.org/ffmaer/sketches/odU88zEVV.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, the hardest part was actually getting the insult generated and displayed by tracery and the casino slot words to line up.</p>
				<p>Because I could not figure out how flatten can access each individual type of obj in the Json file to give to the user, I decided it was best that I parse through the already flattened output and try to grab the words.</p>
				<p>I then made it so each slot, representing the noun, adjective and verb would stop to the word that was generated."</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I am solo but  I think I did not make much complex Tracery grammar rules.</li>
					<li>The biggest challenge was spending all my effort trying to figure out how to make this a more impressive assignment than just a text/insult generator and even with tracery I did not really know if I could come up with anything original. </li>
					<li>My highest point was getting actually animating or making the slots to position themselves currently or stop moving rather than doing much with tracery besides a simple sentence of insulting words.  
					</li>
				</ul>
