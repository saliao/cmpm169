			<h1>Experiment 5 - 3D Graphics</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I watched a cute video called Cat Groove by Peardian on YouTube.</p>
				<p>Link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbN1wh5slnA</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>I learned how to create 3D models and shapes, texture, move objects and cameras from the class guides.</p>
				<p>Oren Shohamâ€™s interactive guide on WebGL from openprocessing: https://openprocessing.org/sketch/794227</p>
				<p>I also learned how to make UV maps in blender and use photoshop for combining textures.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>The interesting thing I did was make the tiles and models feel lively through the texture face change through arrays of dictionary pairs.</p>
				<p>The lighting is also impressive same with random tiles turning on and off look because it looks even more like the dance floor from the video.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I spent way too much time on this but still feel proud.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I think I captured the essence of the original video with the perfect models, lighting and textures.</li>
					<li>I think the biggest challenge was spending all my effort trying to import well textured individual cat models because I had to learn how to use blender to make a cat model UV map and then edit every cat texture to fit the UV maps in photoshop .</li>
					<li>My highest point was definitely finally seeing the textures properly mapped on the models. </li>
				</ul>
