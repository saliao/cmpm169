			<h1>Experiment 2 - Vector Art, Animation & Interactivity</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I picked a manga panel from OPM. The mysterious figure to draw in p5.js</p>
				<p>I did not find any code for imitating the figure so I used ChatGPT to get a stick figure as reference and start from there</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from the existing p5.js library and reference pages, I drew the figure as best as I could and then looked open code from opening processing: https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2036451.</p>
				<p>I Integrated this code into my project by using it as my background and also learning how to modify it and change the blurr and shadows on my figure.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, made it more interactive and animated by looking up how to redraw and also use interactive functions.</p>
				<p>I used these sources to get it going: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54153201/how-do-you-redraw-an-object-created-from-a-class-in-p5-js-javascript</p>
				<p>https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/mouseMoved</p>
				<p>Now when we move the mouse, the figure changes transparncy and the stars change too</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I worked on myself and feel very proud of the work I did in this experiment</li>
					<li>I made a mysterious figure on a moon with a star background.</li>
					<li>I struggled with finding references but enjoyed learning from the p5.js library.</li>
				</ul>
