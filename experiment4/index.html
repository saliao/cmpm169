			<h1>Experiment 4 - Images, Video, & Sound Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>As soon as I heard we can use video images and sound I thought about this meme: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdi19AZvHkQ</p>
				<p>It’s a funny meme with a gif of a cute girl from the video game A Hat in Time dancing  to “Aaron Smith Danci n- (KRONO Remix)” while the background is changing.  I wanted to first recreate this and maybe add different backgrounds instead.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>I mostly took what we learned in class about adding images and videos and made a gif of the girl dancing while an array of videos loop through in the background.</p>
				<p>I also looped music in the assignment and the most annoying part was rescaling and repositioning the girl each time the scene changes.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, made it different from the original video by having the brightness change to fit the background.</p>
				<p>I also added a webcam in the middle of the videos.</p>
				
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Although this work is not impressive at all and on paper pretty easy, it took too long. </li>
					<li>I think I captured the essence of the original video and I had to find my own clips and edit each down to upload to github.  I think the biggest challenge was spending time finding videos to use clips in the background and the tedious amount of work put into matching the girl with the background.</li>
					<li>My highest point was definitely finally experiencing the whole sequence of video, or the final product myself. I hope you enjoy watching and listening to it!</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
